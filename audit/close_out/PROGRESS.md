# Close-out progress (append only)

The live log of the close-out brief (`audit/close_out/BRIEF.md`). One line per finding ID closed, with its pull request
and merge SHA. A later session resumes from this file alone. Lines are never edited; a correction is a new line.

Format: `date · session · workstream · ID · outcome · PR · merge SHA · note`.

## Session A

- 2026-10-10 · A · start · base `main` = `2ddbfb611bb139d9597aec9b6b79153699cc4d94`; open pull requests: none; CI on
  main: Verify run 38061261662 green. Local gates on the base (Python 3.11.17): every CONTRIBUTING §5 gate PASS; cutover
  parity exits 2 (oracle pinned; content parity is the standing gate, as CI accepts); public tools 35/36 (1 not
  applicable); viewport 168/168.
- 2026-10-10 · A · inputs · brief v5 supersedes v4 (owner's mid-session message). `BRIEF.md` is now version 5; version 4
  is kept as `BRIEF_v4.md` for lineage. Owner decisions D1–D15 (v5) recorded verbatim in
  `audit/OWNER_DECISIONS_2026-10-10.md` §5. From here the plan is v5's: one window, stages A–C, a stage report and a
  stop after each stage.
